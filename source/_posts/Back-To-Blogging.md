I have not updated this blog for quite a while.  I read something somewhere about blogging that in order to keep it up a person needs to blog consistently and keep it short.  Otherwise, the effort to blog becomes overwhelming, and the blog quickly dies out.

I have definitely fallen into this trap.  Most of my initial entries were quite involved and were a lot of effort.  Now I will try and keep things quick and short for the most part.  I will occasionally add longer, more technical pieces when justified, but for right now I will concentrate on just building up a habit of writing regularly.
